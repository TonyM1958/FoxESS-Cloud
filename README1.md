# Cloud API

## Setup
To initialise a Jupyter Lab notebook to use the cloud API, copy the following text and edit the configuration variables needed to add your values:

```
!pip install foxesscloud --root-user-action=ignore --quiet
import foxesscloud.foxesscloud as f

# add your info here
f.username = "my.fox_username"
f.password = "my.fox_password"
f.device_sn = "my.fox_device_sn"
f.time_zone = "Europe/London"
f.residual_handling = 1

f.pv_api_key = "my.pv_api_key"
f.pv_system_id = "my.pv_system_id"

f.solcast_api_key = "my.solcast_api_key"

f.plotfile="plot###.png"
f.pushover_user_key = "my.pushover_user_key"
```

Advanced users: use the same sequence in bash/python scripts to install modules and initialise variables in a run time enviromment.

You don't have to configure all of the settings. Your Fox ESS Cloud username, password and device serial number are the minimum required to access data about your inverter.

For example, replace _my.fox_username_ with the login name and _my.fox_password_ with the password you use for [foxesscloud.com](https://www.foxesscloud.com/login) and _my.device_sn_ with the serial number of your inverter. Be sure to keep the double quotes around the values you enter or you will get a syntax error.

Residual handling configures how battery residual energy reported by Fox is handled:
+ 1: Fox returns the current battery residual energy and battery capacity is calculated using soc
+ 2: Fox returns the current battery capacity and battery residual is calculated using soc
+ 3: Fox returns the residual capacity per battery (Mira)

If a value is set for f.plot_file, any charts created will also be saved to an image file:
+ f.plot_file: the file name to use. The file extension determines the format - .png, .pdf or .svg. If you provide just a filename, each chart will over-write the file. The default is None and disables saving.
+ f.plot_no: if the file name contains ###, this will be replaced by 3 digit plot number that increases for each chart created. The default is 0.
+ f.plot_dpi: sets the image resolution. The default is 150. Reducing this value produces smaller, lower resolution images. Increasing this value produces larger, highe resolution images

If you set f.pushover_user_key to your user_key for [pushover.net](https://pushover.net), a summary from set_tariff(), charge_needed(), set_pvoutput() and battery_info() will be sent to your pushover app.

You can set 'f.storage' to a path to save files to a different location such as cloud storage. The default is to use the current working directory.


## Information
Load information about the user, site or device:

```
f.get_info()
f.get_status(station)
```

f.get_info() sets the variable f.info and returns a dictionary containing user information.

f.get_status() sets the variable f.status and returns a dictionary containing status information for devices (station=0) or sites (station=1).

## Site, Logger and Device Information
Load information about a site, data logger or inverter (device):

```
f.get_site()
f.get_logger()
f.get_device()
```

By default, this will load the first item in the list provided by the cloud. If there is more than 1 item, the call will show the list of items. To select a specific item to work with, call a qualifier:
+ Site: full or partial name of the site
+ Logger: full or partial serial number
+ Inverter: full or partial serial number

When an item is selected, the functions returns a dictionary containing item details. For an inverter, a list of variables that can be used with the device is also loaded and stored as var_list

Once an inverter is selected, you can make other calls to get information:

```
f.get_firmware()
f.get_battery(info=1, rated, count)
f.get_batteries(info=1, rated, count)
f.get_settings()
f.get_charge()
f.get_min()
f.get_cell_temps()
f.get_cell_volts()
f.get_named_settings(name)
f.get_work_mode()
f.get_flag()
f.get_templates()
f.get_schedule()
f.get_earnings()

```
Each of these calls will return a dictionary or list containing the relevant information.

get_firmware() returns the current inverter firmware versions. The result is stored as f.firmware.

get_battery() / get_batteries() returns the current battery status, including 'soc', 'volt', 'current', 'power', 'temperature' and 'residual'. The result also updates f.battery / f.batteries.
get_batteries() returns multiple batteries (if available) as a list. get_battery() returns the first battery. Additional battery attributes include:
+ 'info': a list of BMS and battery serial numbers and firmware versions
+ 'capacity': the estimated battery capacity, derrived from 'residual' and 'soc'
+ 'charge_rate': the estimated BMS charge rate available, based on the current 'temperature' of the BMS
+ 'charge_loss': the ratio of the kWh added to the battery for each kWh applied during charging
+ 'discharge_loss': the ratio of the kWh available for each kWh removed from the battery during during discharging

get_battery() / get_batteries() returns the current battery status, including 'soc', 'volt', 'current', 'power', 'temperature' and 'residual'. The result also updates f.battery / f.batteries.
get_batteries() returns multiple batteries (if available) as a list. get_battery() returns the first battery. Parameters:
+ 'info': get BMS and battery serial number info, if available. Default 1.
+ 'rated': optional rated capacity for the battery in Wh to work out SoH. If not provided, it will try to work this out. When there is more than 1 battery, this parameter is a list.
+ 'count': optional battery count. If not provided, it will work this out from the serial number info. When there is more than 1 battery, this parameter is a list.

Additional battery attributes provided include:
+ 'capacity': the estimated battery capacity, derrived from 'residual' and 'soc'
+ 'charge_rate': the estimated BMS charge rate available, based on the current 'temperature' of the BMS
+ 'charge_loss': the ratio of the kWh added to the battery for each kWh applied during charging
+ 'discharge_loss': the ratio of the kWh available for each kWh removed from the battery during during discharging


get_settings() will return the battery settings and is equivalent to get_charge() and get_min(). The results are stored in f.battery_settings. The settings include minSoc, minSocOnGrid, enable charge from grid and the time periods.

get_cell_temps(), get_cell_volts() will return a list of the current cell temperatures and voltages using get_remote_settings().

get_named_setings(), get the value for a setting. Details of settings are held in the dictionary f.named_settings.

get_work_mode() returns the current work mode. The result is stored in f.work_mode.

get_flag() returns the flag information for Mode Scheduler, indicating if this is supported or enabled and also if maxsoc is a required parameter.

get_templates() returns the type 1 and type 2 templates that are stored on the server. The result is stored in f.templates. You can search for templates by name using f.find_template(name)

get_schedule() returns the current work mode / soc schedule settings. The result is stored in f.schedule.

get_earnings() returns the power generated and earning data that is displayed on the Fox web site and in the app.

## Inverter Settings
You can change inverter settings using:

```
f.set_min(minSocOnGrid, minSoc, force)
f.set_charge(ch1, st1, en1, ch2, st2, en2, enable)
f.set_named_settings(name, value, force)
f.set_work_mode(mode)
f.set_period(start, end, mode, min_soc, max_soc, fdsoc, fdpwr, segment)
f.set_schedule(periods, template, enable)
```

set_min() takes the min_soc settings from battery_settings and applies these to the inverter. The parameters are optional and will update battery_settings:
+ minSocOnGrid: min Soc on Grid setting e.g. 15 = 15%
+ minSoc: min Soc setting e.g. 10 = 10%
+ force: setting to 1 will disable Mode Scheduler, if enabled. Default is 0.

set_charge() takes the charge times from the battery_settings and applies these to the inverter. The parameters are optional and will update battery_settings. You should specify all 3 parameter for a time period:
+ ch1: enable charge from grid for period 1 (default True)
+ st1: the start time for period 1 (default 0)
+ en1: the end time for period 1 (default 0)
+ ch2: enable charge from grid for period 2 (default True)
+ st2: the start time for period 2 (default 0)
+ en2: the end time for period 2 (default 0)
+ enable: set to 0 to show settings but stop inverter settings being updated. Default is 1.

set_named_settings() sets the 'name' setting to 'value'.
+ 'name' may also be a list of (name, value) pairs and returns a list of success / fail results.
+ force: setting to 1 will disable Mode Scheduler, if enabled. Default is 0.
+ A return value of 1 is success. 0 means setting failed. None is another error e.g. device not found, invalid name or value.
+ Example names: 'WorkMode', 'ExportLimit'
+ Open API names are translated to their corresponding names e.g. MinSoc, MinSocOnGrid, MaxSoc

set_work_mode(mode) takes a work mode as a parameter and sets the inverter to this work mode. Valid work modes are held in settable_modes. The new mode is stored in work_mode.

set_period() returns a period structure that can be used to build a list of strategy periods for set_schedule()
+ start, end, mode: required parameters. end time is exclusive e.g. end at '07:00' will set a period end time of '06:59'
+ min_soc: optional, default is 10
+ max_soc: optional, default is 100
+ fdsoc: optional, default is 10. Used when setting a period with ForceDischarge mode
+ fdpwr: optional, default is 0. Used when setting a period with ForceDischarge mode.
+ price: optional, default None. Used to display plunge pricing for time period.
+ segment: optional, allows the parameters for the period to be passed as a dictionary instead of individual values.

Before calling set_period(), do at least one call to get_schedule(). This will inspect the schedule result to check if max_soc is supported and set the flag f.schedule['maxsoc'] to enable or disable this field as appropriate.

set_schedule() configures a list of scheduled work mode / soc changes with enable=1. If called with enable=0, any existing schedules are disabled. To enable a schedule, you must provide either a list of periods or a template ID
+ periods: a period or list of periods created using f.set_period()
+ template: a template ID from get_templates() or find_template()
+ enable: 1 to enable a schedule 0 to disable. The default is 1

## History Data
History data reports inverter variables, collected every 5 minutes, on a given date / time and period:

```
f.invert_ct2 = 1
f.get_history(time_span, d, v, summary, save, load, plot, station)
```

'f.get_history' is also available as 'f.get_raw' for backward compatibility:
+ time_span determines the period covered by the data, for example, 'hour', 'day' or 'week'. The default is 'hour'
+ d is a date and time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. The default is today's date and time. d may also be a list of dates
+ v is a variable, or list of variables (see below)
+ summary is optional - see below
+ save: set to the root part of a filename to save the results
+ load: set to the full filename to load previously saved results
+ plot is optional. 1 plots the results with a chart per unit and per day. 2 plots multiple days on the same chart. Default is 0, no plots
+ station is optional. 1 gets data for a site (using f.station_id), 0 gets data for a device (using f.device_id). The default is 0.

The list of variables that can be queried is stored in f.var_list (and also available as f.raw_vars). There is also a pred-defined list power_vars that lists the main power values provided by the inverter. Data generation for the full list of var_list can be slow and return a lot of data, so it's best to select the vars you want from the list if you can.

f.invert_ct2 determines how the meterPower2 data is handled. When invert_ct2 = 0, meterPower2 produces +ve power values during secondary generation. If meterPower2 produces -ve power values during secondary generation, setting invert_ct2 = 1 will flip the values so they are +ve when generating. The default setting is 1 (invert).

f.sample_time is set to the sample time in minutes for the data processed, rounded to f.sample_rounding samples per minute.

For example, this Jupyter Lab cell will load an inverter and return power data at 5 minute intervals for the 17th June 2023:

```
d = '2023-06-17 00:00:00'
result=f.get_history('day', d=d, v=f.power_vars)
```

Setting the optional parameter 'summary' when calling get_history() provides a summary of the raw data

+ summary = 0: basic raw_data, no summary
+ summary = 1: summary is calculated
+ summary = 2: summary is calculated and raw data is removed to save time / space
+ summary = 3: as (2) but for energy only, an hourly cumulative state is also generated, similar to the state used in Home Assistant long term statistics

The summary includes the following attributes:
+ count: the number of data points
+ average: the average value of the data points
+ max: the maximum value of the data points
+ max_time: the time when the maximum value occured (HH:MM)
+ min: the minimum value of the data points
+ min_time: the time when the minimum value occured (HH:MM)

For power values, the summary performs a Riemann sum of the data, integrating kW over the day to estimate energy in kWh. In this case, the following attributes are also added:
+ kwh: the total energy generated or consumed
+ kwh_off: the total energy consumed or generated during the off-peak time of use (off_peak1, off_peak2, off_peak3, off_peak4)
+ kwh_peak: the total energy consumed or generated during the peak time of use (peak1, peak2)
+ kwh_neg: the total energy from -ve power flow (all other totals are based on +ve power flow)

## Report Data
Report data provides information on the energy produced by the inverter, battery charge and discharge energy, grid consumption and feed-in energy and home energy consumption:

```
f.get_report(report_type, d, v, summary, save, load, plot, station)
```
+ report_type sets the period covered by the report and is one of 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year':
+ when 'day' is selected, energy is reported each hour through the day
+ when 'week' is selected, energy is reported for the 7 days up to and including the date
+ when 'month' is selected, energy is reported each day through the month
+ when 'year' is selected, energy is reported each month through the year
+ d is a date and time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. The default is yesterday. d may also be a list of dates
+ v is a variable, or list of variables. The default is to use report_vars
+ summary is optional - see below
+ save: set to the root part of a filename to save the results
+ load: set to the full filename to load previously saved results
+ plot is optional. 1 to plot results
+ station is optional. 1 gets data for a site (using f.station_id), 0 gets data for a device (using f.device_id). The default is 0.

The list of variables that can be reported on is stored in f.report_vars.

Note that reporting by 'day' produces inaccurate hourly data, where the sum does not reconcile with the daily total given in the monthly report. To correct this, reporting by day also gets the monthly data and uses the daily total to correctly report the total.

Setting the optional parameter 'summary' when calling get_report() provides a summary of the report data:

+ summary = 0: basic report data, no summary. report_type cannot be 'week'
+ summary = 1: summary is calculated
+ summary = 2: corrected total only is reported to save time / space. report_type must be 'day'

The result data for each variable includes the following attributes when summary=2
+ 'variable': name of the data set
+ 'total': corrected total of the data items

When summary=1, the following items are also added:

+ 'data': 'index' and 'value' of each data point
+ 'date': that was used to produce the report
+ 'count': the number of data items
+ 'sum': the sum of the data items
+ 'max': the biggest value in 'data'
+ 'max_index': the index of the biggest value in 'data'
+ 'min': the smallest value in 'data'
+ 'min_index': the index of the smallest value in 'data'
+ 'average': corrected average of the data items

For example, this Jupyter Lab cell will report energy data by day for the month of June 2023:

```
d = '2023-06-17'
result=f.get_report('month', d=d)
```

# Built-in Utilities and Operations

The previous section provides functions that can be used to access and control your inverter. This section covers utilities and operations that build upon these functions.


## Charge Needed

Uses forecast PV yield for tomorrow to work out if charging from grid is needed tonight to deliver the expected consumption for tomorrow. If charging is needed, the charge times are configured. If charging is not needed, the charge times are cleared. The results are sent to the inverter.

```
f.charge_needed(forecast, force_charge, forecast_selection, forecast_times, update_setings, show_data, show_plot, timed_mode)
```

All the parameters are optional:
+ forecast: the kWh expected tomorrow (optional, see below)
+ force_charge: 1 any remaining time in a charge period has force charge / min_soc set, 2 charging uses the entire charge period, 0 None (default)
+ forecast_selection: if set to 1, settings are only updated if there is a forecast. Default is 0, generation is used when forecasts are not available
+ forecast_times: a list of hours when forecasts can be obtained. By default, the forecast times for the selected tariff are used (see below)
+ update_settings: 0 no changes, 1 update charge settings. The default is 0
+ show_data: 1 show battery SoC data, 2 show battery Residual data, 3 show timed data. The default is 1.
+ show_plot: 1 plot battery SoC data. 2 plot battery Residual, Generation and Consumption. 3 plot 2 + Charge and Discharge The default is 3
+ timed_mode: 0 use charge times, 1 use charge times and follow strategy, 2 use Mode Scheduler

### Modelling

charge_needed() uses a number of models to better estimate the state of the battery.

**Manual Consumption:** You can provide your expected 'consumption' in kWh e.g. 15. This figure is used directly.

**Annual Consumption:** You can provide your 'annual_consumption' in kWh e.g. 5500. This figure is factored down to a daily consumption by dividing by 365 and applying **f.seasonality**. This normally decreases consumption in the summer and increases it in winter. Seasonality is a list of weightings by month for Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr etc. Preset lists are 'f.high_seasonality' (recommend where electric heating is ued), 'f.medium_seasonality' (default) amd 'f.no_seasonality' (all months the same). The daily consumption is profiled by hour using **f.daily_consumption**. This maps your consumption for a day to the hours when more or less energy is consumed. It is a list of 24 values for the times 00, 01, 02, 03 .. 23. Preset lists are 'f.high_profile' (larger peaks at 8am and 6pm), 'f.medium_profile' (default, more balanced) and 'f.no_profile' (flat).

**Historic Consumption:** If annual_consumption is not provided, your consumption history is used. By default, this looks at your average consumption for the last 3 days using the load power reported by your inverter. For systems with multiple inverters where CT2 is not connected, the load power may not be correct. For this and other cases where you want to set your consumption, provide your annual_consumption.

**Manual Forecast:** You can provide a specific 'forecast' in kWh e.g. 20. This is profiled using **f.seasonal_sun** to map solar generation to the time of day. The mapping is broken down into 4 seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn (winter is Dec, Jan, Feb, spring is Mar, Apr, May etc). There are 4 preset lists: 'f.winter_sun', 'f.spring_sun', 'f.summer_sun' and 'f.autumn_sun'. Seasonal_sun is used for manual and historic forecasts

**Solcast:** If you provide an API key for Solcast, your forecast will be downloaded after 9pm each day and used as the basis for your next days generation (see below).

**Solar:** if you configure one or more **f.solar_array**, forecast.solar will be called to provide a forrecast for your next days generation (see below).

**Historic Generation:** If 'forecast' is not provided and Solcast and Solar forecasts are not available, your generation history is used. By default, this looks at your average solar generation for the last 3 days and applies the **f.seasonal_sun** profile.

Note: if using Solcast or forecast.solar, calls to the API are very limited so repeated calls to charge_needed can exhaust the calls available, resulting in failure to get a forecast. The tariff forecast_times set the hours when forecast data is fetched (see tariffs).

Given the data available, the modelling works as follows:
+ gets current information on your battery
+ estimates your consumption (including contigency)
+ gets forecast data from Solcast or forecast.solar (if configured)
+ gets your generation history
+ uses the charge available now and the expected charging or discharging of the battery to forecast the battery state
+ works out if there is a deficit (i.e. when the battery would be discharged below your min_soc)
+ reports the charge needed (deficit) or the minimum expected battery level
+ updates your battery charge settings (if update_settings is not 0)
+ gets the current work mode and updates this if timed work mode changes are configured

```

These values are stored / available in f.charge_config.

The default battery open circuit voltage curve versus SoC from 0% to 100% is:
```
lifepo4_curve = [51.30, 52.00, 52.30, 52.40, 52.50, 52.60, 52.70, 52.80, 52.9, 53.1, 53.50]
```

When operating in strategy mode (timed_mode=2), charge_needed will create a schedule that includes the strategy for the tariff with additional time periods added to charge from grid and (optionall) to stop the battery discharging. In other modes, charge_needed() will disable any schedules and set the battery charge times.


## Charge Compare

Provides a comparison of a prediction, saved by charge_needed(), with the actuals

```
f.charge_compare(save, v, show_data, show_plot)
```

Produces a plot of the saved data from charge_needed() overlaid with data from get_history():
+ 'save': the name of the file to load
+ 'v': the variables to plot. The default is 'pvPower', 'loadsPower' and 'SoC'
+ show_data: 1 show battery SoC data by hour (default)
+ show_plot: 1 plot battery SoC data. 2 plot battery Residual, Generation and Consumption. 3 plot 2 + Charge and Discharge The default is 3


## Battery Info

Provides detailed information on the current state of the batteries:

```
f.battery_info(count, plot, log)
f.battery_monitor(interval, run, log, save, count)
```

battery_info() prints information on the battery and cells:
+ count: optional over-ride. The default is based on factorising the number of cells reported by 16 or 18 to work out the number of batteries.
+ plot: 1 plot the cell voltages for each battery, 2 also plot the cell temperatueres, 0 don't plot. The default is 1
+ log: see below. Default is 0

battery_monitor() runs battery_info() in log mode on a schedule to provide information on the battery status over a period of time:
+ interval: the time in minutes between log entries. The default is 30 minutes
+ run: the number of log entries to create. The default is 48 i.e. every 30 minues for 24 hours in total
+ log: 0 = display, 1 = log battery info, 2 = add cell volts, 3 = add cell temps. The default is 1
+ save: name of a CSV file to write log data to

## Date Ranges

```
f.date_list(s, e, limit, span, today)
```

Returns a list of dates in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. This function will not return dates in the future. The last date will be yesterday or today (if today is True). All parameters are optional:

+ s: start date
+ e: end date
+ limit: maximum number of days. The default is 200
+ span: the range of dates. One of 'day', 'week', 'month' or 'year', '2days' or 'weekday'
+ today: 1 allows today to be included, 2 allows future dates to be included. Default is 0, date list will stop at yesterday

You can use 'span' as follows:
+ 'day' provides a single day
+ 'week' will provide the dates of 7 consequetive days
+ 'month' will provide the dates of the days up to the same date in the preceeding (or follwing) month
+ '2days' will provide the dates of yesterday and today
+ 'weekday' will provide the dates of the same day of the week, going backwards (or forwards) up to 7 weeks

```
f.british_summer_time(d)                         # 1 if d is in Britsh Summer Time, 0 if not
```

## Time Periods

Times and time period settings are held as decimal hours. Functions for working with time strings with the format 'HH:MM:SS' and decimal hours include:

```
f.time_hours(t, d=None)                          # convert time to decimal hours. t is a time string ('HH:MM' or 'HH:MM:SS'), d is optional and is the default time if s is None
f.hours_time(h, mm=True, ss=False, day=False)    # convert decimal hours to time (HH:MM:SS). mm = include minutes, ss = include seconds, day = include /n for day when hours > 24
f.hours_in(h, {'start': a, 'end': b})            # True if decimal hour h is in the time period a -> b
```

## Tariffs

Tariffs configure when your battery can be charged and provide time of use (TOU) periods to split your grid import and export into peak, off-peak and shoulder times when data is uploaded to PV Ouptut.

There are a number of different pre-configured tariffs:
+ Octopus Flux: off-peak from 02:00 to 05:00, peak from 16:00 to 19:00, forecasts from 22:00 to 23:59. Timed work mode changes to Self Use at 5am and Feed In First at 4pm.
+ Intelligent Octopus: off-peak from 23:30 to 05:30, forecasts from 22:00 to 23:59
+ Octopus Cosy: off-peak from 04:00 to 07:00, 13:00 to 16:00 and 22:00 to 24:00, peak from 16:00 to 19:00, forecasts from 01:00 to 02:59 and 10:00 to 11:59
+ Octopus Go: off peak from 00:30 to 04:30, forecasts from 22:00 to 23:59
+ Agile Octopus: off-peak from 00:00 to 06:00 and 12:00 to 16:00, peak from 16:00 to 19:00, forecasts from 10:00 to 11:59 and 22:00 to 23:59
+ British Gas Electric Driver: off-peak from 00:00 to 05:00, forecasts from 22:00 to 23:59
+ EON Next Drive: off-peak from 00:00 to 07:00, forecasts from 22:00 to 23:59
+ Eco 7: Economy 7: off-peak from 00:30 to 07:30 GMT (01:30 to 08:30 during BST)

Custom periods can be configured for specific times if required:
+ Custom: off-peak from 02:00 to 05:00, peak from 16:00 to 18:59, forecasts from 22:00 to 23:59

The active tariff is configured by calling 'f.set_tariff() with the name of the tariff to use:

```
f.set_tariff('flux')
```

When Agile Octopus is selected, a price based charging period is configured using the 30 minute price forecast. For example:

```
f.set_tariff('agile', product, region, times, forecast_times, strategy, update, weighting, time_shift)
```

This gets the latest 30 minute pricing and uses this to work out the best off peak charging period.
+ product: optional Agile Octopus product code (see below). The default is "AGILE-24-04-03"
+ region: optional region to use for prices (se below). The default is 'H' (Southern England)
+ times: a list of charge periods that can be used instead of start_at, end_by and duration (see below)
+ forecast_times: a list of times when a forecast can be obtained from Solcast / forecast.solar, aligned with the host system time
+ strategy: an optional list of times and work modes (see below)
+ update: optional, 1 (the default) sets the current tariff to Agile Octopus. Setting to 0 does not change the current tariff
+ weighting: optional, default is None / flat (see below)
+ time_shift: optional system time shift in hours. The default is for system time to be UTC and to apply the current day light saving time (e.g. GMT/BST)
+ plunge_price: list of prices in p/kWh when plunge pricing is used (see below). The default is [0, 5].
+ plunge_slots: the number of 30 minute slots to use for plunge pricing. The default is 6, allowing up to 3 hours.
+ show_data: show 30 minute Agile pricing data. Default is 1.
+ show_plot: plot 30 minute Agile pricing data. Default is 1.

Product codes include: 
+ 'AGILE-18-02-21' = The original version capped at 35p per unit
+ 'AGILE-22-07-22' = The cap rose to 55p
+ 'AGILE-22-08-31' = The cap was increased to 78p
+ 'AGILE-VAR-22-10-19' = This version raised the cap to £1 per unit and also introduced a new formula.
+ 'AGILE-FLEX-22-11-25' = Cap stays at £1 per unit but new formula only deducts 17.9p from higher unit prices
+ 'AGILE-24-04-30' = Latest Agile tariff (default)

Region codes include:
+ 'A' = Eastern England
+ 'B' = East Midlands
+ 'C' = London
+ 'D' = Merseyside and Northern Wales
+ 'E' = West Midlands
+ 'F' = North Eastern England
+ 'G' = North Western England
+ 'H' = Southern England (default)
+ 'J' = South Eastern England
+ 'K' = Southern Wales
+ 'L' = South Western England
+ 'M' = Yorkshire
+ 'N' = Southern Scotland
+ 'P' = Northern Scotland

Pricing for tomorrow is updated around 5pm each day. If run before this time, prices from now up to 11pm are used. Prices for tomorrow are fetched after 5pm. The setting for this is:
+ f.agile_update_time = 17

The best charging period is determined based on the weighted average of the 30 minute prices over the duration. The default is flat (all prices are weighted equally, except the last slot, which is pro rata to the charge duration used). You can over-ride the default weighting by providing a list of 30 minute values to apply.

set_tariff() can configure multiple off-peak and peak periods for any tariff using the 'times' parameter. Times is a list of tuples:
+ containing values for key, 'start', 'end' and optional 'force'.
+ recongnised keys are: 'off_peak1', 'off_peak2', 'off_peak3', 'off_peak4', 'peak1', 'peak2'
+ a tuple containing a key with no values will remove the time period from the tariff.

For example, this parameter configures an AM charging period between 11pm and 8am and a PM charging period between 12 noon and 4pm and removes the time period 'peak2':
+ times=[("off_peak1", "23:00", "8:00"), ("off_peak2", "12:00", "16:00"), ("peak2")]

'strategy' allows you to configure times when work modes will be changed. The format is a list of dictionary items, containing:
+ 'start', 'end': times in decimal hours or time format. The end time is exclusive so setting an end time of '07:00' will set a schedule that ends at '06:59'
+ 'mode': the work mode to be used from 'SelfUse', 'Feedin', 'Backup', 'ForceCharge', 'ForceDischarge'
+ 'min_soc, 'fdsoc', 'fdpwr' and 'max_soc': optional values for each work mode. The defaults are 10, 10, 0 and 100 respectively.

Alternatively, if you set strategy='load', the current inverter schedule will be loaded and used.

Any strategy time segments that overlap the charge time periods for the tariff will be dropped.

```
f.get_strategy()
```

get_strategy() creates a list of time segments from the strategy. If strategy is not provided, it uses the strategy for the current tariff. If a strategy includes settings for the AM/PM charge times for the tariff, the times will be moved so they do not conflict with the charge time used by charge_needed().

Plunge pricing allows for the automatic configuration of charging periods when Agile prices are low:
+ 'plunge_pricing is a list of prices. If the price for a 30 minute period is below this price, a plunge charging period is added to the schedule. 'plunge_pricing' is a value or list of values. When a list is used, the values are spread over 24 hours starting with the first value at 7am. So, for example, if 2 prices are provided, the first applies between 7am and 7pm and the second applies between 7pm and 7am. This allows different prices to be applied for day-time and night-time. If 3 prices are provided, each covers 8 hours so the time slots are 7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm and 11pm-7am. With 4 prices, each covers 6 hours so the time periods are 7am-1pm, 1pm-7pm, 7pm-1am, 1am-7am etc.
+ 'plunge_slots' sets the maximum number of 30 minute plunge charging slots to use. The default is 8.


# PV Output
These functions produce CSV data for upload to [pvoutput.org](https://pvoutput.org) including PV generation, Export, Load and Grid consumption by day in Wh. The functions use the energy estimates created from the raw power data (see above). The estimates include PV energy generation that are not otherwise available from the Fox Cloud. Typically, the energy results are within 3% of the values reported by the meters built into the inverter.


## Get PV Output Data

Returns CSV upload data using the [API format](https://pvoutput.org/help/api_specification.html#csv-data-parameter):

```
f.integrate_load_power=0
f.get_pvoutput(d, tou)
```

+ d is the date or a list of dates, to get data for. The default is yesterday.
+ tou: the default, tou=0, does not split data and is more accurate. Setting tou=1 uploads data with time of use. Setting tou=2 integrates all values and allows set_pvoutput() to work with pv inverters that do not provide energy stats.
+ setting integrate_load_power to 1 will calculate load energy by integrating the load power instead of using data from Fox. This tries to overcome the limitation where the inverter does not track load power / energy correctly when there is secondary generation. When set to 0 (default), the  Fox load energy is used.

You can copy and paste the output data to the pvoutput data CSV Loader, using the following settings:

![image](https://github.com/TonyM1958/FoxESS-Cloud/assets/63789168/21459cdc-a943-4e9d-a204-7efd45a422d8)

For example, this Jupyer Lab cell will provide a CSV data upload for June 2023:

```
f.get_pvoutput(f.date_list('2023-06-01', '2023-06-30'))
```

## Set PV Output Data

Loads CSV data directly using the PV Ouput API:

```
f.set_pvoutput(d, system_id, tou, push, run_after)
```

+ d is optional and is the date, or a list of dates, to upload
+ system_id is optional and allow you to select where data is uploaded to (where you have more than 1 registered system)
+ tou: the default, tou=0, does not split data and is more accurate. Setting tou=1 uploads data with time of use. Setting tou=2 integrates all values and allows set_pvoutput() to work with pv inverters that do not provide energy stats.
+ push: optional. 0 = do not sent to pushover, 1 = send summary to pushover, 2 = send first day summary only
+ run_after: optional. Only generate data on or after this hour. Default 0.


# Solar Forecasting

## Solcast

Get and display solar data from your solcast.com account using your API key:

```
f.solcast_api_key = "my.solcast_api_key"
fcast = f.Solcast()
print(fcast)
```

Returns a 7 day forecast. Optional parameters are:
+ days: number of days to get. The default is 7
+ estimated: whether to get history / estimated data. 1 = yes, 0 = no. Default is 0.
+ reload: cached data handling. 0 = use saved data, 1 = fetch new data, 2 = use saved data for today (default)

+ shading: parameters to control shading at the start and end of the day (see Solar Forecasts)

Forecast data is saved to f.solcast_save. The default is 'solcast.txt'.

```
fcast.plot_daily()
fcast.plot_hourly(day)
fcast.plot_pt30(day)
fcast.compare(day, raw, v)
```

Plots the estimate / forecast data. plot_daily() plots the daily yield. plot_hourly() plots each day separately by hour. plot_pt30() plots 30 minute slots.
+ day: optional. 'today', 'tomorrow', 'all' or a specific list of dates. The default is to plot today and tomorrow

compare() will get actual data from your inverter and plot this against the forecast:
+ 'day' is the date to plot (YYYY-MM-DD). The default is today.
+ 'raw' 1 will also plot the raw forecast array (rid) data. Default is 0 (don't plot)
+ 'v' is a list of inverter variables to plot. The default is 'pvPower'

## Forecast.solar

Get and display solar data from forecast.solar for today and tomorrow:

```
f.solar_array('South', lat=51.1789, lon=-1.8262, kwp=6.4)
```

You need to configure your solar arrays by calling f.solar_array(). This takes the following parameters:
+ name: the name of each of your arrays
+ lat: the latitude where the array is located. The default is Stonehenge.
+ lon: the longitude where the array is located. The default is Stonehenge.
+ dec: the declination of the array - 0 is lying flat and 90 is vertical. Default is 30
+ az: azimuth of the array. 0 is pointing due South, -90 is pointing East, 90 is pointing West. The default is 0
+ kwp: the size of the array in kWp. The default is 5kWp
+ dam: damping factor. Default is None
+ inv: inverter power limit (when the array will clip). The default is None
+ hor: a list of values describing obstructions on the horizon

Add one array for each string attached to your inverter. If your solar production is limited by clipping, set the inverter power so the forecast better matches your generation.

See the [API documentation](https://doc.forecast.solar/api) for more information on parameter values.

```
fcast = f.Solar()
print(fcast)
```

Returns a forecast for today and tomorrow. Optional parameters are:
+ reload: cached data handling. 0 = use saved data, 1 = fetch new data, 2 = use saved data for today (default)
+ quiet: set to True to stop Solar producing progress messages
+ shading: parameters to control shading at the start and end of the day

Forecast data is saved to f.solar_save. The default is 'solar.txt'.

```
fcast.plot_daily()

fcast.plot_pt30(day)
fcast.compare(day, raw, v)
```

Plots the estimate / forecast data. plot_daily() plots the daily yield. plot_hourly() plots each day separately by hour. plot_pt30() plots 30 minute slots.
+ day: optional. 'today', 'tomorrow', 'all' or a specific list of dates. The default is to plot today and tomorrow

compare() will get actual data from your inverter and plot this against the forecast:
+ 'day' is the date to plot (YYYY-MM-DD). The default is today.
+ 'raw' 1 will also plot the raw forecast array (rid) data. Default is 0 (don't plot)
+ 'v' is a list of inverter variables to plot. The default is 'pvPower'

## Sun Times and Shading

Shading reduces the outut of the solar panels due to shadows covering the sun. The forecasts use a simple shading model that allows for reduced generation due to obstacles that obstruct the panels as the sun rise and sets. This is based on 2 structures:

'f.suntimes' is a list of UTC sunrise and sunset times for the 1st day of each month of the year (12 x value pairs). 'f.suntimes' to values that are specific to you. The default values are based on central England:

```
sun_times = [
    ('08:13', '16:07'), ('07:46', '16:55'), ('06:51', '17:48'),     # Jan, Feb, Mar
    ('05:41', '18:41'), ('04:37', '19:31'), ('03:55', '20:15'),     # Apr. May, Jun
    ('03:54', '20:27'), ('04:31', '19:54'), ('05:20', '18:51'),     # Jul, Aug, Sep
    ('06:09', '17:43'), ('07:01', '16:38'), ('07:51', '16:00')]     # Oct, Nov, Dec

f.get_suntimes(date, utc)

'shading': {
        'solcast': {'adjust': 0.95, 'am_delay': 1.0, 'am_loss': 0.2, 'pm_delay': 1.0, 'pm_loss': 0.2},
        'solar':   {'adjust': 1.20, 'am_delay': 1.0, 'am_loss': 0.2, 'pm_delay': 1.0, 'pm_loss': 0.2}
        },
```

'f.get_suntimes' returns the sunrise and sunset times as a tuple for the date provided by interpolating from 'f.sun_times':
+ date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
+ utc: 1 = return time in UTC. 0 = return local time (default)

'shading' adjusts the forecast and sets delays and losses caused as the sun rise and set for Solcast and Solar. The forecast is multiplied by 'adjust'. The (AM/PM) delay is the time after sunrise or before sunset that is applied and 'loss' is the amount that the solar forecast is reduced. The default structure above is used by Solcast and Solar when called from charge_needed() or they can be passed directly as parameters when forecasts are being created using 'f.Solcast()' and 'f.Solar()'. If the delays are presented as a list, they are values for winter, spring, summer and autumn.



# Pushover

Send messages to a pushover user account:

```
f.output_spool(app_key, h)
f.output(s)
f.output_close(plot, file)
f.output_message(app_key, message, plot)
```

Calling f.output_spool() with an app key will start the system spooling output to send to pushover. h is an optional header to add as the first line of the message. H may include \<time\>, \<date\> or \<datetime\> and these will be set to current system time and date respectively.

When spooling is active, any calls to f.output() add lines to the spooled message. If appending to the message would exceed 1024 characters, the existing spooled message is sent and a new message spool is started.

Calling f.output_close() will send the spooled message and optionally attach a binary image file. You can set plot=1 to attach the last plot file created (when f.plot_file is set) or specify a file.

f.output_message() is a shorcut to send a message without spooling output.


# Troubleshooting

If needed, you can add the following setting to increase the level of information reported by the foxesscloud module:

```
f.debug_setting = 2
```

This setting can be:
+ 0: silent mode (minimal output)
+ 1: information reporting (default)
+ 2: more debug information
+ 3: lots of debug information
